Assume Google has recently indexed and saved billions of Web pages in its database. Then you conduct a search using a specified phrase. The term you typed is then loaded into Google's database, and it produces a list of what it considers to be the most relevant pages to your search... And, to put it lightly, it does an excellent job.
But how does it determine which pages are the most important? Here is a list of factors that Google considers when assessing relevance:
The Content - Google is a big fan of words. When indexing a page, it looks at the words on the page to determine the topic. It also examines the words on the page to determine if the keywords you entered in your search are present in the content.
Title tag - is the content that appears at the top of your browser, in the tab. It is also the headline used by Google when it returns its results. Google again checks to verify if the keywords in your title tag match the terms in your search.
Description - The description is the paragraph text that appears in the Google search results. Google will also scan to see if there are any keyword matches in this.
URL - This is your page's Web address. Google will also take a look at the keywords used here.
Backlinks - Backlinks are links to your page from other, external web pages. When it comes to backlinks, Google considers a variety of variables, including the relevance of the page link, the popularity of the website, and many more. You can get backlinks by doing Guest Posting for your website.
This is only a partial list of the elements that Google considers when determining the relevancy of its indexed sites to your search. You can also benefit from learning about
